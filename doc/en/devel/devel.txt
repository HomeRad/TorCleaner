As with all OpenSource projects, it is easy for you to help or advance
WebCleaner.

The easiest thing is probably sending me URLs of web pages that do
not work correctly through the WebCleaner proxy.

If you want to implement a feature you need for yourself, here are
some suggestions that might be helpful.

- You will need additional software packages to work with the
  `WebCleaner CVS`_ repository:
  
  - a cvs client
  - automake >= 1.9
  - libtool
  - python docutils >= 3.3
  
  Instructions to pull the CVS version are at the `WebCleaner CVS`_
  repository page.
  After checking out the CVS tree, run ``./autogen.sh`` to generate
  all the Makefiles. Then run ``make localbuild`` to compile a
  local version. To start the proxy run ``scripts/startdev.sh config``.

- When you want to send me patches, try to make them against
  the latest released version or the CVS tree.
  For example you can use ``cvs diff -u > mypatch.diff`` to generate
  a CVS diff.
