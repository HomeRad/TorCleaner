====================================
Specification of content rating data
====================================

This document defines the data and mechanisms used to
rate internet pages. This can be used to enable surfing
sessions that are limited to specified contents, and is
especially useful for allowing children to experience the
web in a safe manner.

Rating
======
A rating is a dictionary filled with name/value items.
Each name/value item is an instance of a defined rating format.

Rating format
=============
A rating format defines a unique, case insensitive name, and a range
of valid values along with their interpretation.

URL rating
==========
A URL rating relates a rating to one or more URLs. It consists of
a rating, an URL and an optional generic flag specifying that all
URLs with the given URL as base path apply to the rating.

Rating service
==============
A complete rating service defines a unique name and the used
rating format. The service name should be an URL with human-viewable
information about the service.

Furthermore the service delivers ratings of given URLs.

Service delivery
================
Several different rating delivery methods are defined.
They allow content providers flexibility when providing
rating data.

HTTP Header
-----------
When answering a HTTP request, rating data can be submitted as
HTTP headers. All headers start with "X-Rating" and are defined
as follows:

- X-Rating: <service URL>
  submits the service this rating applies to
- X-Rating-<name>: <value>
  submits one name/value item of the rating dictionary

HTTP header names are defined case insensitive. This is the reason
why rating names, which are used as part of HTTP header names, are
also defined case insensitive.

HTML meta data
--------------
A HTML file can be rated by supplying data in a meta tag.
The format is basically the same as the HTTP header format,
using "X-Rating" in the name attribute and the value in the
content attribute.

WebCleaner service
==================
As you might have guessed by now, the WebCleaner software delivers
both a full featured rating service, and supports to deploy and
enforce it on your computer. You can even submit your own ratings
to the service. Below you will find a short description of the
