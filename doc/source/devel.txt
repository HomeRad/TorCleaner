Development
===========

As with all OpenSource projects, it is easy for you to help or advance
WebCleaner.

The easiest thing is probably sending me URLs of web pages that do
not work correctly through the WebCleaner proxy.

If you want to implement a feature you need for yourself, here are
some suggestions that might be helpful on a UNIX workstation.

- You will need additional software packages to work with the
  `WebCleaner Subversion`_ repository:
  
  - a subversion client
  - automake >= 1.9
  - libtool
  - python docutils >= 3.3
  
  Instructions to pull the Subversion version are at the
  `WebCleaner Subversion`_ repository page. The quick way is to run:
  
  ::
  
   svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/webcleaner/trunk/webcleaner2 webcleaner
  
  After checking out the Subversion tree, run ``./autogen.sh`` to generate
  all the Makefiles. Then run ``make localbuild`` to compile a
  local version. To start the proxy run ``scripts/startdev.sh config``.

- When you want to send me patches, try to make them against
  the latest released version or the Subversion repository.
  For example you can use ``cvs diff -u > mypatch.diff`` to generate
  a CVS diff.

SSL Gateway
===========

Warning
-------
The SSL gateway is still considered in development, so use with care.


Introduction
------------

An SSL gateway enables filtering of https traffic by spawning an SSL
server on the local host (port 8443 per default) through which all
secure traffic is routed.


Security
--------

An SSL gateway has the disadvantage of having to fake the SSL certificate
from the original server and replace it with our own certificate, which
uses the owner name "WebCleaner Server".
Your browser will issue a warning that this certificate is not the
original one your requested.
So in order to not weaken your secure web surfing experience, make sure
you have set up the WebCleaner SSL gateway yourself and configure it
to not allow administration of another person except yourself.
