Why should I use WebCleaner?
============================

The first feature that sets WebCleaner apart from other proxies is
exact HTML filtering, and this removes a lot of advertisings.
The filter does not just replace some strings, the proxy parses all HTML
data. The parser is fast (written in C) and can cope with every
broken HTML page out there; if the parser does not recognize HTML
structures, it just passes the data over to the proxy until it recognizes
a tag again. No valid HTML data is ever discarded or dropped.

Another feature is the JavaScript filtering: JavaScript data is
executed in the integrated Spidermonkey JavaScript engine which is also
used by the Mozilla browser suite.
This eliminates all JavaScript obfuscation, popups, and document.write()
stuff, but the other JavaScript functions still work as usual.

Exact HTML filtering has another good side-effect: it is possible to
detect and prevent known security flaws in HTML processors. Several
known (but not all) buffer overflow exploits or Denial of Service
attacks are detected and fixed by the HtmlSecurity class.

If you find an HTML exploit that is not covered by the security filter,
please let me know.

Furthermore, WebCleaner can filter SSL traffic used in ``https://`` URLs.
See the `SSL gateway`_ documentation for more info.

.. _SSL gateway: devel/sslgateway.html


Configuration
=============

Assuming your proxy runs on port *8080*, point your browser to
http://localhost:8080/ to configure the proxy.
The underlying configuration format is a custom XML format. It is
specified by the files `filter.dtd`_ and `webcleaner.dtd`_.

.. _filter.dtd: filter/filter.dtd
.. _webcleaner.dtd: filter/webcleaner.dtd


Running
=======

Please note that the web configuration interface needs write permissions
in the configuration directory.


Running under Unix/Linux
------------------------

The proxy is supervised and automatically (re-)started from the runit
package.
See the `runit homepage`_ for more information.

.. _runit homepage: http://smarden.org/runit/

Running under Windows
---------------------

The proxy is a normal NT service and can be started/stopped from the
"Administrative Tasks" entry in the system configuration.

Setting access permissions
--------------------------

To allow using your proxy from other hosts than the one it is running
on, you have to edit the allowed host list in the configuration
interface.

For example to allow access from your local LAN network at
``192.168.1.*`` you would add ``192.168.1.1/8`` to the allowed host
list.

If you do allow access from other hosts than your own, please do not
remove the password protection.
Otherwise you will be running an `open proxy`_ which is a security risk.
