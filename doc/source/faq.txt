Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

**Q: The URL I am surfing at is not rendered correctly, it is blank, it misses
some tags or is completely crippled.**

A: First, try to disable the WebCleaner proxy by using the configuration
shortcut ``http://localhost:8080/config.html?disablefilter=1``.
Then look at the page again.
If it renders ok, you most likely have encountered a bug in WebCleaner.
Please write a `bug report`_ and include the URL you have problems with.

**Q: I am paranoid. What should I do besides running WebCleaner?**

A: The default config of WebCleaner is strict when it comes
to passing private information, so there is not more that can
be done (except adding new filters yourself).
