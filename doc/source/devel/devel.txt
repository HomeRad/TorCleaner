As with all OpenSource projects, it is easy for you to help or advance
WebCleaner.

The easiest thing is probably sending me URLs of web pages that do
not work correctly through the WebCleaner proxy.

If you want to implement a feature you need for yourself, here are
some suggestions that might be helpful on a UNIX workstation.

- You will need additional software packages to work with the
  `WebCleaner Subversion`_ repository:
  
  - a subversion client
  - automake >= 1.9
  - libtool
  - python docutils >= 3.3
  
  Instructions to pull the Subversion version are at the
  `WebCleaner Subversion`_ repository page. The quick way is to run:
  
  ::
  
   svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/webcleaner/trunk/webcleaner2 webcleaner
  
  After checking out the Subversion tree, run ``./autogen.sh`` to generate
  all the Makefiles. Then run ``make localbuild`` to compile a
  local version. To start the proxy run ``scripts/startdev.sh config``.

- When you want to send me patches, try to make them against
  the latest released version or the Subversion repository.
  For example you can use ``cvs diff -u > mypatch.diff`` to generate
  a CVS diff.
