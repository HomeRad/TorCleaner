            WebCleaner - a filtering HTTP proxy
	   =====================================


Features
--------
o disable animated GIFs
o compress documents on-the-fly (with gzip)
o enhance your privacy (remove/add HTTP headers and obfuscate IP address)
o remove unwanted HTML (adverts, javascript, ...)
o completely customizable to suit your (filtering) needs
o single process proxy with select() I/O
o HTTP/1.1 support


Installing
----------
Read the file INSTALL


Configuration
-------------
Run the nice GUI config tool "webcleanerconf".
The underlying configuration format is a custom XML format which is
explained in config/filter.dtd and config/webcleaner.dtd.


Notes
-----
WebCleaner is _not_ an HTTP compliant proxy because it modifies requests,
headers and data!

Obfuscate IP address does not spoof your address, it just encodes the
IP numbers in one big integer. This is known to *not* work with
a Squid parent proxy.

Yes, surf performance will decrease, espacially with the Rewriter module
enabled.


Credits
-------
Credits go to munchy.py from Neil Schemenauer <nascheme@enme.ucalgary.ca>.
The original proxy class is based on his code.
The new proxy code is based on the fourth incarnation of Amit's web proxy.

The filter code design is inspired from FilterProxy, a Perl program from
Bob McElrath <mcelrath+filterproxy@draal.physics.wisc.edu>.

Me, Bob and the author of AIFilter (Tels) had a nice discussion about
filter formats with good ideas. Tels convinced me to try stateful
filtering and I realize that it is very nice indeed.
Disabling animated GIFs is a question of honor, but the idea goes back to
the Webwasher.

Also, the Surfboard (surfboard.sourceforge.net) is a very inspiring
HTTP/1.1 proxy written in Java.
