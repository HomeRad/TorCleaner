Frequently asked questions
--------------------------

**Q: I cannot install the proxy.**

A: Please read and follow the `installation instructions`_. They
are quite detailed and should help you out. Sometimes, new versions
require some more software packages to be installed, so check if
you have all required software for WebCleaner installed.

.. _installation instructions: install.html

**Q: I installed everything ok, but the proxy does not start up.**

A: Please read the startup error message and mail it to me along
with your system configuration. Under Unix systems, error messages
will be printed in /var/service/webcleaner/log/main/current.
Under Windows systems, where WebCleaner is installed as NT service,
look in the application log in the NT event log viewer.

**Q: The filter is not working - I still see some advertisings that are
definitely filtered out.**

A: Send the URL to calvin@users.sf.net and I will add a filter rule for it.


**Q: The URL I am surfing at is not rendered correctly, it is blank, it misses
some tags or is completely crippled.**

A: First, try to disable the WebCleaner proxy and look at the page again.
If it renders ok, you most likely have encountered a bug in WebCleaner.
Please write a bug report to calvin@users.sf.net and
include the URL you have problems with.

**Q: I am seeing the error "client sent data in state receive".**

A: Your client was sending data when it shouldn't have. This is mostly
a broken HTTP proxy (eg. when WebCleaner is parent proxy of Oops).

**Q: Are there security concerns running this proxy?**

A: Yes.

- Be sure no one but you or your users can access the proxy.
  The default configuration is that only local users can
  access the proxy. Additionally, you should define a proxy password.
- WebCleaner uses 3rd-party libraries and inherits their potential
  security flaws.

**Q: I get "zlib error" entries in my error log.**

A: Some b0rked servers are sending Content-Type: gzip for pages
that are not compressed. In this case WebCleaner switches to
non-compressing filtering and prints the above error.

**Q: I am paranoid. What should I do besides running WebCleaner?**

A: The default config of WebCleaner is strict when it comes
to passing private information, so there is not more that can
be done (except adding new filters yourself).
