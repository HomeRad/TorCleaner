Patch guidelines
----------------

1) Version
Send only patches against the latest released version or even better
against the CVS version.

2) Unified diffs
Make sure you send unified diff files, for example with
"diff -BurN webcleaner webcleaner_patched > mypatch.diff".
You can use "cvs diff -u" if you work with the CVS version.

3) Python programming styleguide
Trying to follow my programming style will save me a lot of time applying
your patch:
- indent only with spaces, not with TABs
- indentation level is always 4 spaces
- no line should be longer than 80 characters
- function and class definitions must have a space between name and
argumentslist:

def myfunction (arg1, arg2): pass
class C (object): pass
- applications must not have a space:

res = myfunction(val1, val2)
c = C()
- every class must be inherited from "object". If a base class is still
an old-style class, use multiple inheritance. For example the
"asyncore.dispatcher" class is not inherited from "object". So the
"Connection" class is defined with:

  class Connection (asyncore.dispatcher, object):
  #...
  Make sure the old-style class is listed first, before the "object" class.
