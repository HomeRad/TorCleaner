As with all OpenSource projects, it is easy for you to help or advance
WebCleaner.

The easiest thing is probably sending me URLs of web pages that do
not work correctly through the WebCleaner proxy.

If you want to implement a feature you need for yourself, here are
some suggestions that might be helpful.

- When generating patches, they should be against the latest released
  version or the CVS tree. Instructions to pull the CVS version are
  at the `WebCleaner CVS`_ repository page.

- Unified diffs are much more readable, for example you can use
  ``diff -BurN webcleaner webcleaner_patched > mypatch.diff``, or
  ``cvs diff -u`` if you work with the CVS version of WebCleaner.

- A consistent programming style helps others read and understand
  the code. For that Python has released a
  `Style Guide for Python Code`_
