The proxy code is based on the fourth incarnation of Amit's web proxy.

The filter code design is inspired from FilterProxy, a Perl program from
Bob McElrath <mcelrath+filterproxy@draal.physics.wisc.edu>.

Me, Bob and the author of AIFilter (Tels) had a nice discussion about
filter formats with good ideas. Tels convinced me to try stateful
filtering and I realize that it is very nice indeed.

Disabling animated GIFs is a question of honor, but the idea goes back to
the Webwasher.

The HTML parser is inspired from HotSAX.

Thanks to CoAdvisor, for extracting all the important RFC stuff for
non-caching proxies in their test case documentation.

Thanks to Colin Stewart for making simpleTAL.
