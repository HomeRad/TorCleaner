Q: The filter is not working - I still see some advertisings that are
   definitely filtered out.
A: Look in the HTML source. Some adverts (eg. freshmeat.net) are
   generated with JavaScript. You have these possible solutions:
   * turn off JavaScript
   * generate a JavaScript (Rewrite) filter and restrict it to the urls you
     (dont) want to have JavaScript
     This works only with JS in <script> tags.
   * generate a Blocker filter which at least blocks the image download
     (I normally prefer this solution).

Q: The URL I am surfing at is not rendered correctly, it is blank, it misses
   some tags or is completely crippled
A: First, try to disable the WebCleaner proxy and look at the page again.
   Or try adding "noproxy." before the url hostname to turn off filtering.
   If it renders ok, you most likely have encountered a bug in WebCleaner.
   Please write a bug report to calvin@users.sourceforge.net and
   include the URL you have problems with.

Q: I am seeing the error "client sent data in state receive".
A: Your client was sending data when it shouldn't have. This is mostly
   a broken HTTP proxy (eg. when WebCleaner is parent proxy of Oops).

Q: Are there security concerns running this proxy?
A: Yes.
   1) Be sure no one but you or your users can access the proxy.
      The default configuration is that only local users can
      access the proxy. Additionally, you should define a proxy password.
   2) Every user with granted access can read the configuration.

Q: I get "zlib error" entries in my error log.
A: Some b0rked servers are sending Content-Type: gzip for pages
   that are not compressed. In this case WebCleaner switches to
   non-compressing filtering and prints the above error.

Q: I am paranoid. What should I do besides running WebCleaner?
A: The default config of WebCleaner is strict when it comes
   to passing private information, so there is not more that can
   be done (except adding new filters yourself).
