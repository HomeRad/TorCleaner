Q: The filter is not working - I still see some advertisings that are
   definitely filtered out.
A: Look in the HTML source. Some adverts (eg. freshmeat.net) are
   generated with JavaScript. You have these possible solutions:
   * turn off JavaScript
   * generate a JavaScript (Rewrite) filter and restrict it to the urls you
     (dont) want to have JavaScript
     This works only with JS in <script> tags.
   * generate a Blocker filter which at least blocks the image download
     (I normally prefer this solution).

Q: The URL I am surfing at is not rendered correctly, it is blank, it misses
   some tags or is completely crippled
A: First, try to disable the WebCleaner proxy and look at the page again.
   If it renders ok, you most likely have encountered a bug in WebCleaner.
   Please write a bug report to calvin@users.sourceforge.net and
   include the URL you have problems with.

Q: I am seeing the error "client sent data in state receive".
A: Your client was sending data when it shouldn't have. This is mostly
   a broken HTTP proxy (eg. when WebCleaner is parent proxy of Oops).

Q: Are there security concerns running this proxy?
A: Yes.
   1) Be sure no one but you or your users can access the proxy.
      The default configuration is that only local users can
      access the proxy. Additionally, you should define a proxy password.
   2) Every user with granted access can read the configuration.

Q: I get "zlib error" entries in my error log.
A: Some b0rked servers are sending Content-Type: gzip for pages
   that are not compressed. In this case WebCleaner does not try to
   decompress the content but prints the above error.
