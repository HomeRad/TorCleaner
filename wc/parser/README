Goals for the HTML parser:
==========================

1) Reentrant
As soon as any HTML string data is available, WebCleaner tries to feed it
to the HTML parser. This means that the parser has to scan possible
incomplete data, recognizing as much as it can. Incomplete trailing
data is saved for subsequent calls (or it is just flushed away with the
flush() function).
A reset() brings the parser back to its initial state, throwing away all
buffered data.

2) Coping with HTML syntax errors
Most HTML pages do not have correct syntax. Browsers go to great length
to recover from such errors and reconstruct the HTML parse tree.
Other standalone HTML parsers try to do it too.
But WebCleaner does not need reconstruction for two reasons:
a) Reconstruction means changing information in the past. This means
   the final HTML parse tree would only available at end-of-data time.
b) Error recovery is complex and itself error prone. Duplicating the
   effort of the browser is moot.
Other parsers (especially bison parsers) allow to skip over errors and
discard tokens. This is also not acceptable.
Instead, the parser has to recognize as much as it can and pass the rest
of the data as TEXT.

3) Speed
Parsing has to be fast.


Solutions:
==========

1) I use a beta FLEX snapshot from ftp://ftp.uncg.edu/people/wlestes/ to
have a reentrant scanner. It works together with a pure (reentrant)
bison parser.

2) The scanner only passes complete recognized HTML syntax elements to
the parser. Invalid syntax elements are passed as TEXT. This way we do
not need the bison error recovery.
Incomplete data is rescanned the next time the parser calls yylex() or
flush()ed.

3) The FLEX code has options to generate a large but fast scanner.
The parser ignores forbidden or unnecessary HTML end tags.
The parser converts tag and attribute names to lower case for easier
matching.
The parser quotes all attribute values with minimal necessity.
