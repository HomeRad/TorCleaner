                     Installation
                    ==============

Requirements
------------
1. You need a C compiler (for example the GNU C Compiler gcc).
  For Windows, install MinGW and MSYS from http://mingw.sourceforge.net.
  Install MinGW first, then MSYS
2. Python >= 2.3.1 from http://www.python.org/
  Your Python installation has to be compiled with the
  expat XML parser module. The expat library needed for this can be
  found at http://expat.sourceforge.net/.
3. Python Imaging Library (PIL) from http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
4. Python Crypto Module from http://www.amk.ca/python/code/crypto.html

For compiling under Unix/Linux, the gettext package for calling
msgmerge is needed.

Optional requirements
---------------------
For faster code execution you can install psyco from
http://psyco.sourceforge.net/

For the optional GUI config tool webcleanerconf you need
FOX Toolkit >= 1.0.0 from http://www.fox-toolkit.org/fox.html
FXPy >= 1.0.0 from http://fxpy.sourceforge.net/

Setup for Unix/Linux:
---------------------
Run "./configure; make" to compile the included C libraries.
Run "python setup.py build" to compile the Python files.
The CC environment variable is checked before compilation, so you can
change the default C compiler with "export CC=myccompiler".
Run "python setup.py install" to install everything.
Note: if you work from CVS, you must run "./autogen.sh" first to
generate the configure and Makefile files.

Setup for Windows:
------------------
XXX this is incomplete, needs python patch...
Inside mingw32 shell do "./configure; make" to compile the included
C libraries.
Run "python setup.py build -c mingw32" to compile the Python files.
Run "python setup.py install" to install everything.
