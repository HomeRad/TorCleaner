                     Installation
                    ==============

Requirements
------------
You need a C compiler (for example the GNU C Compiler gcc).

Python >= 2.3 from http://www.python.org/
Your Python installation has to be compiled with the
expat XML parser module. The expat library needed for this can be
found at http://expat.sourceforge.net/.

For the GUI config tool webcleanerconf you need
FOX Toolkit >= 1.0.0 from http://www.fox-toolkit.org/fox.html
FXPy >= 1.0.0 from http://fxpy.sourceforge.net/

Setup
-----
Run "./configure; make" to compile the included JavaScript library.
Run "python setup.py build" to byte-compile the Python files.
Run "python setup.py install" to install everything.
Note: if you work from CVS, you must run "./autogen.sh" first to
generate the configure and Makefile files.
