Requirements
------------
You need a C compiler (most notably the GNU C Compiler gcc).

Python >= 2.2 from http://www.python.org/
Your Python installation has to be compiled with the
expat XML parser module. The expat library needed for this can be
found at http://expat.sourceforge.net/.
For Python << 2.3 you'll need the python-logging module from
http://www.red-dove.com/python_logging.html

For the GUI config tool webcleanerconf you need
FOX Toolkit >= 1.0.0 from http://www.fox-toolkit.org/fox.html
FXPy >= 1.0.0 from http://fxpy.sourceforge.net/

Setup
-----
Run "./configure; make" to compile everything.
Install with "make install".
Note: if you work from CVS, you must run "./autogen.sh" first to
generate the configure and Makefile files.
