                     Installation
                    ==============

Requirements
------------
Python >= 2.2 from http://www.python.org/

For JavaScript filtering you'll need the SpiderMonkey JS engine
from ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/js/js-1.5-rc5.tar.gz

For the GUI config tool webcleanerconf you need
FOX Toolkit >= 1.0.0 from http://www.fox-toolkit.org/fox.html
FXPy >= 1.0.0 from http://fxpy.sourceforge.net/
Additionally, your Python installation has to be compiled with the
expat XML parser module. The expat library needed for this can be
found at http://expat.sourceforge.net/.

Setup
-----
To install, execute "python setup.py install".
Run "python setup.py install --help" for help on install options.

To enable JavaScript filtering, edit setup.py and set USE_JS=1.

The HTML parser
---------------
If you want (but its not necessary), you can rebuild the htmlparse.c 
and htmllex.c files from the .l and .y source files.
You will need
- bison parser generator
- the flex snapshot release, available from the WebCleaner homepage
  or from ftp://ftp.uncg.edu/people/wlestes/.
You have to adjust the FLEX variable in wc/parser/Makefile to point
to your flex binary.
Then, do a "make localbuild".
