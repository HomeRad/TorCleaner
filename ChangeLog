  * Dont filter comments in *.oreillynet.com - they have some funky
    JavaScript stuff and Mozilla renders the page not good if there
    are no HTML comments.
    Changed files: config/misc.zap
  * Use lists and "".join(list) in HtmlFilter.buffer2data, which gives
    a pretty good speedup when filtering big HTML files.
    Changed files: wc/filter/Rewriter.py
  * Always send our Accept-Encoding header, but remember what the
    client could understand.
    Changed files: wc/proxy/HttpClient.py, wc/proxy/HttpServer.py,
      wc/proxy/ClientServerMatchmaker.py
  * Only compress files when the client accepts the gzip encoding.
    Changed files: wc/filter/Compress.py
  * Some b0rked servers send a gzip encoding when the file is not
    compressed. So the decoding disables the decompression when such
    an error is encountered.
    Changed files: wc/proxy/GunzipStream.py
  * updated documentation and german translation
    Changed files: README, FAQ, po/de.po

0.59

0.58:
  * Set the 'Via' HTTP header when forwarding requests/responses

    so the above is not even noticed :)
  * Add a 'Warning' HTTP header when content-encoding is changed
  * Honor the 'Max-Forwards' HTTP header for OPTIONS requests
  * Adjust empty paths in requests to be '/'. This was causing
    "puzzling header received" errors.
