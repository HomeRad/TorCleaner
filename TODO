version 2.20

- document how to install a proxy that can be used from outside
  (intranet or internet)

- every intern string should be Unicode:

yfilter

    return self.tag == tag   
UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xac in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)               

version 2.21 and above

- use ssl-cert-check bash script

- Python 2.4 made socket.sslerror a subclass of socket.error; can we
  use that?

- add functional tests

invalid js url:

http://adstome.com/phpads/adjs.php?n=864959011&what=zone:5&exclude=,

- squid uses an external auth configuration, we could use that too

- http://www.sane.com/demo/NetTracker/intranet/index.html
  JS navi not there

- ssl certificate verification

- memory leaks while operating the proxy

- allow filtering/blocking by MIME type

- bfilter has Flash parse and generation library, I want that too .)

- test NTLM authentication
  Mozilla >= 1.6b can test NTLM server auth, squid can test client auth

- NTLM: restore old method type when method was not GET

- NTLM: reconnect to parent proxy after first 407 error (squid closes
  the connection)

- unicode parsing for flex
  the HTML parser (written with flex) does not support unicode, so
  sometimes you'll see '?' chars in the HTML output.

- IPv6 support (there are some stubs already, but untested, and DNS
  library is missing IPv6 support)
  Big problem: how do we decide when to send out IPv6 DNS queries?

- integrate with http://mute-net.sourceforge.net/ somehow?
  integrate with Coral somehow (appending .nyud.net:8090)?

- use IPpy.py
