TODO

version 2.1

- parse authentication challenge into tokens according to rfc2617

- support Digest authentication (rfc 2069)
  see urllib2.py for basic implementation

- fix BADURLS entry for JS src fetching with content

version 2.2 and above

- support NTLM authentication, add README.squid example config
  (Mozilla Windows >= 1.4b can test NTLM auth)

- HTTPS tunneling (RFC 2818)

- PICS features:
  for non-PICS-enabled sites, try to fetch info from rating services
  when no PICS info is available, display dialog to build own PICS
  database (after password authentication)
  this should integrate with the webgui configuration somehow

- documentation for the webgui interface

- dockapp to visualize config and status
  I made machine-parseable config and status output, so write a tool
  that uses it :)

- unicode parsing for flex
  the HTML parser (written with flex) does not support unicode, so
  sometimes you'll see '?' chars in the HTML output.

- webcleanerconf: sortable filters (with up/down)
  The order in which filters are applied should be customizable through
  the GUI.

- Use FOX 1.2 Python bindings (fxpy 1.2)
  When FOX 1.2 is released, help to update fxpy to this release using
  the new SWIG 1.3 code.
