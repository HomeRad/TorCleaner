TODO

- webgui configuration

- HTTPS tunneling (RFC 2818)

- PICS features:
  for non-PICS-enabled sites, try to fetch info from rating services
  when no PICS info is available, display dialog to build own PICS
  database (after password authentication)
  this should integrate with the webgui configuration somehow

- Digest and NTLM authentication schemes
  (Mozilla Windows >= 1.4b can test NTLM auth)

- Python 2.3: (note: wait for Python 2.3.1 :)
  o use Bool type
  o use builtin timeout in socket module
  o The socket module now provides the functions inet_pton and inet_ntop for
    converting between string and packed representation of IP addresses.
    There is also a new module variable, has_ipv6, which is True iff the
    current Python has IPv6 support. See SF patch #658327.

- unicode parsing for flex
  the HTML parser (written with flex) does not support unicode, so
  sometimes you'll see '?' chars in the HTML output.

- webcleanerconf: sortable filters (with up/down)
  The order in which filters are applied should be customizable through
  the GUI.

- Use FOX 1.2 Python bindings (fxpy 1.2)
  When FOX 1.2 is released, help to update fxpy to this release using
  the new SWIG 1.3 code.

- dockapp to visualize config and status
  I made machine-parseable config and status output, so write a tool
  that uses it :)

- test parent proxy authentication
  I never tested this.
