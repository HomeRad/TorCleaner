TODO

- fetching JS in background invalidates some buffer/encoder states (!?)
  verrry baaaad, must have invariants for buffering data when the call
  gets interrupted and the same data is parsed/fed again...

- different authentication schemes

- PICS rule parsing (implements whitelist operation)

- if we know the mime type (eg <script src="">) then add it if its missing
  (feature: mime hints)

- Python 2.3: (note: wait for Python 2.3.1 :)
  o use Bool type
  o use builtin timeout in socket module
  o use logging package (get rid of debug, warn, info, error functions)
  o The socket module now provides the functions inet_pton and inet_ntop for
    converting between string and packed representation of IP addresses.
    There is also a new module variable, has_ipv6, which is True iff the
    current Python has IPv6 support. See SF patch #658327.

- unicode parsing for flex
  the HTML parser (written with flex) does not support unicode, so
  sometimes you'll see '?' chars in the HTML output.

- webcleanerconf: sortable filters (with up/down)
  The order in which filters are applied should be customizable through
  the GUI.

- Use FOX 1.2 Python bindings (fxpy 1.2)
  When FOX 1.2 is released, help to update fxpy to this release using
  the new SWIG 1.3 code.

- dockapp to visualize config and status
  I made machine-parseable config and status output, so write a tool
  that uses it :)

- test parent proxy authentication
  I never tested this.

- more error/warning recognition in parser
  o parser should correct typos in start/end tags,
    I noticed this with <blink></bllnk>: it doesnt get filtered, and blinks.
    Annoying!
  o HTML bugs should issue a warning on stderr.
