- FXPy program to watch headers and connections

- Rule matching in C for speed

- Windows installation routine

- HTTPS support (only proxy, no filtering)
  It's sort of an extension to HTTP - you just send the proxy the request
  CONNECT home.netscape.com:443 HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n
  and after reading all the response headers and a blank line you
  have a transparent connection

- new filtering:
  Stop/limit Javascript Pop-ups/alert/confirms
    javascript:
     window.onload=window.onunload=window.onbeforeunload=null;window.close();
  Highlight keywords
