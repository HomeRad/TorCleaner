TODO

- dont use "rewrite" flag, but "nofilter"
- setuid nouser, setgid nogroup on POSIX systems
- using linkchecker on a wc proxy still gives "puzzling header received"
  --> something is not thread-safe!
- webcleanerconf: sortable filters (with up/down)
- test parent proxy authentication
- more error/warning recognition in parser
- error recovery in parser (damn it!)
- strict whitelist operation (for parents)
- unicode parsing for flex (not yet supported)

WONTDO

- javascript popup filtering. There is already a nice option for this
  on Mozilla (>= 0.9.4) under Edit->Preferences->Advanced->Scripts
