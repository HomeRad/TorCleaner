- Update help text and .po files

- the reload throws and exception:
  File "./webcleaner", line 152, in ?
    main()
  File "./webcleaner", line 141, in main
    msg = getattr(daemon, command)()
  File "./wc/daemon/__init__.py", line 56, in restart
    start()
  File "./wc/daemon/_posix.py", line 37, in start
    startfunc()
  File "./wc/__init__.py", line 95, in startfunc
    proxy.mainloop()
  File "./wc/proxy/__init__.py", line 143, in mainloop
    handlerCount = proxy_poll(timeout=max(0, run_timers()))
  File "./wc/proxy/__init__.py", line 76, in proxy_poll
    (r,w,e) = select.select(r,w,e, timeout)
  select.error: (4, 'Interrupted system call')

- additionally give _all_ modules the URL info

- more status info (look at surfboard: the WM applet is cool)
  o uptime
  o successful handled requests
  o invalid requests
  o active connections
  o cookies

- new filtering:
  Stop/limit Javascript Pop-ups/alert/confirms
    javascript:window.onload=window.onunload=window.onbeforeunload=null;window.close();
  Stop refreshs for specific ad frames
  Remove dynamic HTML
  Control sounds
  Highlight keywords

- NT specific functions in daemon module (works now with generic functions)

- HTTPS support
  It's sort of an extension to HTTP - you just send the proxy the request
  CONNECT home.netscape.com:443 HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n
  and after reading all the response headers and a blank line you
  have a transparent connection
