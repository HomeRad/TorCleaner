TODO

- additionally give _all_ modules the URL info

- more status info (look at surfboard: the WM applet is cool)
  o uptime
  o successful handled requests
  o invalid requests
  o active connections
  o cookies

- new filtering:
  Stop/limit Javascript Pop-ups/alert/confirms
    javascript:window.onload=window.onunload=window.onbeforeunload=null;window.close();
  Stop refreshs for specific ad frames
  Remove dynamic HTML
  Control sounds
  Highlight keywords

- Update help text and .po files

- NT specific functions in daemon module (works now with generic functions)

- HTTPS support
  It's sort of an extension to HTTP - you just send the proxy the request
  CONNECT home.netscape.com:443 HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n
  and after reading all the response headers and a blank line you
  have a transparent connection
