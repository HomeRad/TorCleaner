TODO

version 2.24 and above

- Mac OS X support for network interface list:
  http://lists.helixcommunity.org/pipermail/client-dev/2004-May/001032.html

- SSL gateway seems to have a recursive redirection problem.
  Investigate this.

- empty page after first load
  It seems the browser closes the client connection prematurely.
  Have to test with other browsers as well.

- use ssl-cert-check bash script

- install gettext _() with unicode=1

- Test "www.%s" DNS search pattern for automationpartnership.com

- Python 2.4 made socket.sslerror a subclass of socket.error; can we
  use that?

- add functional tests

invalid js url:

- squid uses an external auth configuration, we could use that too

- http://www.sane.com/demo/NetTracker/intranet/index.html
  JS navi not there

- ssl certificate verification

- memory leaks while operating the proxy

- allow filtering/blocking by MIME type

- bfilter has Flash parse and generation library, I want that too .)

- test NTLM authentication
  Mozilla >= 1.6b can test NTLM server auth, squid can test client auth

- NTLM: restore old method type when method was not GET

- NTLM: reconnect to parent proxy after first 407 error (squid closes
  the connection)

- unicode parsing for flex
  the HTML parser (written with flex) does not support unicode, so
  sometimes you'll see '?' chars in the HTML output.

- IPv6 support (there are some stubs already, but untested, and DNS
  library is missing IPv6 support)
  Big problem: how do we decide when to send out IPv6 DNS queries?

- use IPpy.py
