TODO

version 2.4

- test proxy.pac stuff
  http://wp.netscape.com/eng/mozilla/2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html


version 2.5 and above

- test the rule merging stuff

- documentation for the webgui interface

- use test/client.py, test/server.py for testing

- support NTLM authentication, add README.squid example config
  (Mozilla Windows >= 1.4b can test NTLM server auth, squid can test
   client auth)

- NTLM: restore old method type when method was not GET

- NTLM: reconnect to parent proxy after first 407 error (squid closes
  the connection)

- Desc: empty page (JS flush error...)
  Url: http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/author/dhtml/reference/objects/embed.asp

- Desc: nothing is clickable, works without proxy (and w/o javascript filter)

- HTTPS gateway functionality

make sure that the certificate file includes:

    * (optional) a chain of certificates from a known certificate authority to your server certificate
    * the server certificate
    * the private key; the key may not be password-protected

The file should be in PEM format. The OpenSSL command to generate a self-signed certificate in the correct format would be something like:


    openssl req -x509 -newkey rs:1024 -keyout test.pem -out test.pem -days 365 -nodes

Note the '-nodes' flag - it's important!

HTTPS CERTIFICATES

If a client browser connects via HTTPS and if it presents a
certificate and if HTTPSHeaders is set, Pound will obtain the
certificate data and add the following HTTP headers to the
request it makes to the server:

- X-SSL-Subject: information about the certificate owner
- X-SSL-Issuer: information about the certificate issuer (CA)
- X-SSL-notBefore: begin validity date for the certificate
- X-SSL-notAfter: end validity date for the certificate
- X-SSL-serial: certificate serial number (in decimal)

It is the application's responsibility to actually use these
headers - Pound just passes this information without checking
it in any way (except for signature and encryption correctness).

Please note that this mechanism allows forgeries: a client may
(maliciously) send these headers to Pound in order to masquerade
as an SSL client with a specific certificate. If this is a problem
for your application make sure to deny these requests: add

    HeadDeny X-SSL-Subject ".*"
    HeadDeny X-SSL-Issuer ".*"
    HeadDeny X-SSL-notBefore ".*"
    HeadDeny X-SSL-notAfter ".*"
    HeadDeny X-SSL-serial ".*"

- PICS features:
  for non-PICS-enabled sites, try to fetch info from rating services
  when no PICS info is available, display dialog to build own PICS
  database (after password authentication)
  this should integrate with the webgui configuration somehow

- dockapp to visualize config and status
  I made machine-parseable config and status output, so write a tool
  that uses it :)

- unicode parsing for flex
  the HTML parser (written with flex) does not support unicode, so
  sometimes you'll see '?' chars in the HTML output.

- webcleanerconf: sortable filters (with up/down)
  The order in which filters are applied should be customizable through
  the GUI.

- Use FOX 1.2 Python bindings (fxpy 1.2)
  When FOX 1.2 is released, help to update fxpy to this release using
  the new SWIG 1.3 code.

- HTTP/1.1 pipelining

- IPv6 support (there are some stubs already, but untested, and DNS
  library is missing IPv6 support)
