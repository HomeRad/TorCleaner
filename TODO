TODO

- if we know the mime type (eg <script src="">) then add it if its missing

   File "/home/calvin/projects/webcleaner/wc/proxy/HttpClient.py", line 244, in server_content
     assert self.server
     AssertionError

- Python 2.3: (note: wait for Pthon 2.3.1 :)
  use Bool type
  use builtin timeout in socket module
  use logging package (get rid of debug, warn, info, error functions)

- unicode parsing for flex
  the HTML parser (written with flex) does not support unicode, so
  sometimes you'll see '?' chars in the HTML output.

- webcleanerconf: sortable filters (with up/down)
  The order in which filters are applied should be customizable through
  the GUI.

- Use FOX 1.2 Python bindings (fxpy 1.2)
  When FOX 1.2 is released, help to update fxpy to this release using
  the new SWIG 1.3 code.

- dockapp to visualize config and status
  I made machine-parseable config and status output, so write a tool
  that uses it :)

- test parent proxy authentication
  I never tested this.

- more error/warning recognition in parser
  o parser should correct typos in start/end tags,
    I noticed this with <blink></bllnk>: it doesnt get filtered, and blinks.
    Annoying!
  o HTML bugs should issue a warning on stderr.

- strict whitelist operation (for parents)
  To use this as a real kids-enabled tool.
