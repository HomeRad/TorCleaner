TODO

- Windows: the block files are not found because of mixing slashes
  and backslashes in the path name (use os.path.norm)

- htmlop.l:
  better support for <! > tags
  support for <? ?> tags

- test Cookies

- test .zap update with webcleanerconf

- new filtering:
  Stop/limit Javascript Pop-ups/alert/confirms
    javascript:
     window.onload=window.onunload=window.onbeforeunload=null;window.close();
  Highlight keywords

- Buffering Replacer

- HTTPS support (only proxy, no filtering)
  It's sort of an extension to HTTP - you just send the proxy the request
  CONNECT home.netscape.com:443 HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n
  and after reading all the response headers and a blank line you
  have a transparent connection
