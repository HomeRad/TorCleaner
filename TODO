TODO

version 2.11 and above

- ssl certificate verification

- use test/client.py, test/server.py for testing

- memory leaks while operating the proxy

- allow filtering/blocking by MIME type?

- bfilter has Flash parse and generation library, I want that too .)

- the error "Empty image data found" - what causes it??

- test NTLM authentication
  Mozilla >= 1.6b can test NTLM server auth, squid can test client auth

- NTLM: restore old method type when method was not GET

- NTLM: reconnect to parent proxy after first 407 error (squid closes
  the connection)

- unicode parsing for flex
  the HTML parser (written with flex) does not support unicode, so
  sometimes you'll see '?' chars in the HTML output.

- IPv6 support (there are some stubs already, but untested, and DNS
  library is missing IPv6 support)
