TODO

- log rotating (and remove logs in postrm)
- blocking does not work (displays status config instead)
  ==> make a blocking test
- doh! i am blocking my own links (adverts.zap.txt)
- better DNS lib (hangs sometimes ?)

- new filtering:
  Stop/limit Javascript Pop-ups/alert/confirms
    javascript:
     window.onload=window.onunload=window.onbeforeunload=null;window.close();
  Stop refreshs for specific ad frames
  Remove dynamic HTML
  Control sounds
  Highlight keywords

- HTTPS support (only proxy, no filtering)
  It's sort of an extension to HTTP - you just send the proxy the request
  CONNECT home.netscape.com:443 HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n
  and after reading all the response headers and a blank line you
  have a transparent connection
