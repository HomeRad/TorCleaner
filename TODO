TODO

version 2.9 and above

- memory leaks while operating the proxy

- .deb update does not work

- .deb empty password should not be accepted

- content rating:
  o feature: content rating cache update rating_cache_merge_with(ratings)
  o feature: mail ratings to author
  o command line script to put squidguard blacklists into content rating
    cache

- bfilter has Flash parse and generation library, I want that too .)

- use test/client.py, test/server.py for testing

- test NTLM authentication
  Mozilla >= 1.6b can test NTLM server auth, squid can test client auth

- NTLM: restore old method type when method was not GET

- NTLM: reconnect to parent proxy after first 407 error (squid closes
  the connection)

- unicode parsing for flex
  the HTML parser (written with flex) does not support unicode, so
  sometimes you'll see '?' chars in the HTML output.

- HTTP/1.1 pipelining
  if used, an assertion is triggered like this:
  AssertionError: client in state receive sent data 'GET http://XXX HTTP/1.1

- blocked HTTPS urls are broken because we switch to http://
  instead the proxy should support https requests.

- HTTPS gateway functionality

make sure that the certificate file includes:

    * (optional) a chain of certificates from a known certificate authority to your server certificate
    * the server certificate
    * the private key; the key may not be password-protected

The file should be in PEM format. The OpenSSL command to generate a self-signed certificate in the correct format would be something like:


    openssl req -x509 -newkey rs:1024 -keyout test.pem -out test.pem -days 365 -nodes

Note the '-nodes' flag - it's important!

HTTPS CERTIFICATES

If a client browser connects via HTTPS and if it presents a
certificate and if HTTPSHeaders is set, Pound will obtain the
certificate data and add the following HTTP headers to the
request it makes to the server:

- X-SSL-Subject: information about the certificate owner
- X-SSL-Issuer: information about the certificate issuer (CA)
- X-SSL-notBefore: begin validity date for the certificate
- X-SSL-notAfter: end validity date for the certificate
- X-SSL-serial: certificate serial number (in decimal)

It is the application's responsibility to actually use these
headers - Pound just passes this information without checking
it in any way (except for signature and encryption correctness).

Please note that this mechanism allows forgeries: a client may
(maliciously) send these headers to Pound in order to masquerade
as an SSL client with a specific certificate. If this is a problem
for your application make sure to deny these requests: add

    HeadDeny X-SSL-Subject ".*"
    HeadDeny X-SSL-Issuer ".*"
    HeadDeny X-SSL-notBefore ".*"
    HeadDeny X-SSL-notAfter ".*"
    HeadDeny X-SSL-serial ".*"

- IPv6 support (there are some stubs already, but untested, and DNS
  library is missing IPv6 support)
