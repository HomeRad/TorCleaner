TODO

- timeouts do not cancel the request, they occur more than once. Why?

- test this: http://www.nba.com/allstar2003/AS_Ballot.html

- Python 2.3:
  use Bool type
  use builtin timeout in socket module
  use logging package (get rid of debug, warn, info, error functions)

- unicode parsing for flex
  the HTML parser (written with flex) does not support unicode, so
  sometimes you'll see '?' chars in the HTML output.

- webcleanerconf: sortable filters (with up/down)
  The order in which filters are applied should be customizable through
  the GUI.

- Use FOX 1.2 Python bindings (fxpy 1.2)
  When FOX 1.2 is released, help to update fxpy to this release using
  the much faster new SWIG 1.3 code. Then the gui tools will be
  considerably faster.

- dockapp to visualize config and status
  I made machine-parseable config and status output, so write a tool
  that uses it :)

- test parent proxy authentication
  I never tested this.

- more error/warning recognition in parser
  o parser should correct typos in start/end tags,
    I noticed this with <blink></bllnk>: it doesnt get filtered, and blinks.
    Annoying!
  o HTML bugs should issue a warning on stderr.

- strict whitelist operation (for parents)
  To use this as a real kids-enabled tool.

WONTDO

- javascript popup filtering. There is already a nice option for this
  on Mozilla (>= 0.9.4) under Edit->Preferences->Advanced->Scripts
