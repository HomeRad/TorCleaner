 WWW filters are configuration files for blocking URLs and rewriting
 HTML and image data and HTTP headers.
 Each file must have exactly one filter element (the "root" element).
 Each filter can have any number of rules (including zero).
 Filter files should have a .zap extension.
 In DATA sections, the following characters must be XML-encoded:
 Character	Code
   <             &lt;
   >             &gt;
   &             &amp;
   "             &quot;
   '             &apos;

-->


<!--                      Filter

   The filter and each rule element has a "disable" attribute. By default
   it is "0" which means the filter resp. the rule is enabled.
   This way configuration tools can display the description "desc" of all
   filters and rules and can enable/disable each of them separately.

   The filter is identified by filename.
   
   The lang attribute can restrict the filter only to this language,
   which is used for language-specific regular expressions.
   If there is no lang attribute, this filter can be used by all
   languages. This is because some programs might do language specific
   things with regular expressions.

<!--                        Rewriter

   The rewrite tag applies to HTML tags and can replace (or delete if
   the replacement data is empty) arbitrary HTML tag blocks.
   The tag name is a case insensitive string.

   If there is no <replace> tag the complete tag will be removed.

   attribute or nothing.

<!--                       Blocker

    Here we can specify urls to block. We split urls in 
    scheme://host:port/path;parameters?query#fragment
    and can specify regular expressions to match each fragment.
    The host and scheme regular expressions are case insensitive.

    The element data specifies the URL to show when the block matches.
    Applications should have a default URL.

<!--                       Block Domains

    The traditional way of a lot of filter proxies is to block a list
    of domains. This filter specifies a filename with one domain per
    line.
    There is a bl2wc.py script to convert SquidGuard blacklists to
    WebCleaner .zap rules.
    The file can be gzip-compressed.

<!--                       Block Urls

    SquidGuard as 'urls' files as blacklists specifying both host and
    path information.

    WebCleaner .zap rules.
    The file can be gzip-compressed.
