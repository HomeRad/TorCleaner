                    Configuration Help
                   ====================

Under normal circumstances, you should use the webcleanerconf(1)
program (or the web config, when its finished) to configure WebCleaner.
But of course you can edit the *.zap and webcleaner.conf files
manually with your favourite text editor.

For the configuration files syntax see webcleaner.dtd and filter.dtd.
